## 📌 Objectives

* Explore trends in influenza cases across New York counties
* Visualize infection trends and correlations
* Clean and preprocess real-world health data
* Apply regression models to predict infection counts
* Evaluate and compare model performances

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

* Temporal features: `Year`, `Month`, `Week Ending Date`
* Demographics: `Population`, `Median Age`, `Household Size`
* Economic indicators: `Unemployment Rate`, `Median Family Income`
* Health facilities: `Beds in Hospitals`, `Discharges`
* Disease specifics: `Disease`, `Season`, `Region`, `County`
* Target: `Infected` (Number of infected individuals)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

* Distribution plots for infection data
* Monthly infection trends using line charts
* Correlation heatmaps between features and infection count

---

## 🛠️ Preprocessing

* Missing value imputation using mean strategy
* Standard scaling of numerical features
* Outlier removal with IQR method
* One-hot encoding of categorical variables
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualization

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Several models were trained and evaluated using:

* **R² Score**
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

| Model                          | Description                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Decision Tree Regressor        | Simple, interpretable model          |
| Random Forest Regressor        | Ensemble-based, improved accuracy    |
| Support Vector Regressor       | Captures complex relationships       |
| K-Nearest Neighbors            | Distance-based predictions           |
| Linear Regression              | Baseline linear model                |
| Logistic Regression (Optional) | Classification of infection severity |
